# deep-learning-challenge
### Goal
To create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
#### Data
A CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years.

The following variable is the target for the model: was the money used successfully.
The following variables are the features for the model: application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization, status, income classification, special considerations for application, funding amount requested.

The following variables should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features: identification columns (EIN and NAME).


How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?
Summary: Summarize the overall results of the deep learning model. Include a recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem, and then explain your recommendation.
